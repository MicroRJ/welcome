### About Me

Iâ€™ve been programming for about 6 years.                                                                                                         
Most of my time programming has been spent on personal projects and freelancing.                                                                                                            
For the most part, I work on the Windows OS (using Win32 - C++).                                                                                                                             
I have an extensive background in creating low and high-level programs.                                                                                                                        
I like programming things from the ground up, coming up with new ways of achieving something, and using creative yet performant methods.                                                                                                                                      
I value quality over quantity and I believe that code should document itself.

### I consider myself to be a good fit because I value the following principles. 
 
- **Team Aware**. I consider myself to be extremely auto-sufficient, which I find to be a good thing in certain cases. However, as a member of a team working together is necessary. I don't have any problems relying on others in order to meet deadlines and requirements. I am able to adapt and work around pre-existing code. 

- **Good work ethics**. I value product quality and functionality.  I like to meet deadlines while optimizing my workflow to better enable team members to understand my programming patterns and outward interfaces. 

- **Dependable**. I like testing the final product to ensure the utmost quality, predictability, and reliability. I don't like having doubts or assuming how other modules behave. I make sure I understand operability before incorporation. To aid others I write self-documenting code and if necessary will take extra time to append clarifying notes or diagrams.

- **Fast Learner**. I take pride in being a fast learner. After all, in such a competitive industry, your ability to learn is trivial.
