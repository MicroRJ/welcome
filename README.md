### About Me

Iâ€™ve been programming for about 6 years.                                                                                                         
Most of my time programming has been spent on personal projects and freelancing.                                                                                                            
For the most part, I work on the Windows OS (using Win32 - C++).                                                                                                                             
I have an extensive background in creating low and high-level programs.                                                                                                                        
I like programming things from the ground up, coming up with new ways of achieving something, and using creative yet performant methods.                                                                                                                                      
I value quality over quantity and I believe that code should document itself.

### Work Example
As a freelancer, I've had to work both on the front and back end of web applications. 
Some of the tools I've used are Angular, React, Firebase, Heroku, Node JS, MongoDB, and Spring. 

This is an example of work I had to do for a client.  
He wanted a website that he could showcase to his investors in less than a week.
This website required an admin section where he could manage his inventory. 
For the database, I ended up using firebase, as I was very familiarized with it from previous projects although MongoDB would have been a better fit. 
This meant that I could focus more on getting a minimum viable product that was functional and interactive ready within the short deadline. 
Having a database service that interfaces with JSON natively meant that it would work with JSON Java libraries. In this case, I used my own, because it required next to no setup. 
This is just one example and admittedly, I would not use Angular again for such projects. Being extremely cumbersome and honestly, a pain to set up. 
That is one of the reasons why I later switched to using React.   
React allowed me to be more expressive and forward compatible, not to mention how much faster it was to set up, it being a JS library.
I started using React with Electron. 
Even though I am a native developer for both Android and Windows I was interested in the idea of a single code base and cross-platform user-interface support, which would allow me to expand to bigger more elaborate jobs without taking too much time or adding extra costs.
In many cases, clients wanted a native because it could be used offline or simply because it added an extra layer of professionalism.  

### I consider myself to be a good fit because I value the following principles. 
 
- **Team Aware**. I consider myself to be extremely auto-sufficient, which I find to be a good thing in certain cases. However, as a member of a team working together is necessary. I don't have any problems relying on others in order to meet deadlines and requirements. I am able to adapt and work around pre-existing code. 

- **Good work ethics**. I value product quality and functionality.  I like to meet deadlines while optimizing my workflow to better enable team members to understand my programming patterns and outward interfaces. 

- **Dependable**. I like testing the final product to ensure the utmost quality, predictability, and reliability. I don't like having doubts or assuming how other modules behave. I make sure I understand operability before incorporation. To aid others I write self-documenting code and if necessary will take extra time to append clarifying notes or diagrams.

- **Fast Learner**. I take pride in being a fast learner. After all, in such a competitive industry, your ability to learn is trivial.
