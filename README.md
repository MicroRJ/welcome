### About Me

Iâ€™ve been programming for about 6 years.                                                                                                         
Most of my time programming has been spent on personal projects and freelancing.                                                                                                            
For the most part, I work on the Windows OS (using Win32 - C++).                                                                                                                             
I have an extensive background in creating low and high-level programs.                                                                                                                        
I like programming things from the ground up, coming up with new ways of achieving something, and using creative yet performant methods.                                                                                                                                      
I value quality over quantity and I believe that code should document itself.
